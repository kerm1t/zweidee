- k-means, here and then division by zero, around here: a) init k-means
- running a second time (SPACE) might be wrong due to initialization?
- test border cases, e.g. 0 clusters

+ VStudio projects: galaga, frogger, pitstop, comanche, demo1, demo2
- not draw on a rectangle, but on a sphere (or an old CRT monitor)
+ create second project: just draw some stuff on screen, i.e. without engine
- concept:
  a) let m_render in engine
  b) put m_render in main --> pass as argument to engine (maybe better)
     ... maybe after all not such a good idea, as engine needs to resize drawing upon
     resizewindow

+ 2dbuf --> zweidee.h
